# Python Implimentation of the Wave-Function-Collapse Algorithm

## Execution
 - To run the code, just run the `run.py` file
 - Parameters such as the amount of tiles in each direction as well as the pixel size of the output image can be set in the `run.py` file with the `xy` and `image_dimensions` variabless

## Dependancies:
 - This program only uses the python imaging library (PIL / Pillow)
    - Install with: `pip install Pillow`

## Shoutouts
 - Code took reference from a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM)
